/**
 * AggsAdapter: Transparent wrapper for aggregations
 *
 * This module provides transparent conversion between direct aggregation properties
 * and a unified aggs structure pattern. The wrapper is completely confined to the
 * library boundaries - items are automatically wrapped when leaving libraries and
 * unwrapped when entering.
 *
 * Key Principles:
 * - Transparency: Users never need to think about wrapping/unwrapping
 * - Boundary Confinement: All complexity stays within library boundaries
 * - Automatic: Wrapping happens on output, unwrapping happens on input
 * - Unified API: External code always sees aggs structure, regardless of backend
